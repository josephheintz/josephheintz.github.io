<p>It can be difficult to figure out and learn how to use raw HTML and CSS in a practical situation. However, utilizing UI frameworks like Bootstrap 5 can allow for much more freedom and flexibility.  I have personally only tried using Bootstrap 5 and this is my first time learning HTML and CSS so it was very confusing in the beginning. When we started learning Bootstrap it was also a bit difficult to get the hang of. Although the difference in efficiency and successfully coding things the way I wanted was very noticeable. After learning Bootstrap 5 I was able to understand and write correct code much faster, as well as having so many more tools to use. Learning how to use UI frameworks definitely takes a bit of a time-investment, but in the end it is highly worth it.
The biggest advantage to UI frameworks is the structure and pre-written tools that it provides. Which ultimately increases development speed by a great amount. Bootstrap 5 comes with grids, forms, buttons, navbars and much more. Having these tools accessible will allow you to focus on the overall performance of your code, rather than dealing with the small things. This is similar to using raw Javascript and then adding the use of underscore causing functional-programming. Having the ability to focus on the bigger picture and not have to take unnecessary time coding a small unimportant part of your project.
One of the other benefits to using UI frameworks is the consistency and responsiveness it brings. They allow for compatibility across other browsers as well as accessibility amongst users and web developers. In the end, taking some extra time to learn frameworks is an extremely good idea. You can create well-made web applications at faster speeds and have a less stressful time developing your program.</p>
