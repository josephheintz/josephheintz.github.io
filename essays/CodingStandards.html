<p>Everyone that has ever coded in their life knows how irritating it is to finally finish their program and it does not run correctly or at all. Coding standards are an extremely helpful way of learning the language, keeping your program organized, and writing it successfully. I was unsure of what to expect when we set up ESLint and the coding standards in IntelliJ. However, I think it was a really nice addition to my coding experience while using IntelliJ for WODs and coding assignments. Having a coding standard to adhere by really keeps my code organized and simple to read. While also having ESLint to highlight any errors in my code or remind of small things that will cause an error in running the code. Simple things like missing a semicolon or not having a new line after my final line of code. It creates a prototype in your head of a specific format and coding structure to adhere by, making coding flow faster. The ability to quickly think of how to solve a problem or debug your program comes much easier when your code is organized well. Other than the fact it makes it easier for you to understand your code, it allows readability for anyone else trying to look at your source code. After using IntelliJ with ESLint for a week has really helped me learn Javascript and the correct structure it needs to run. Sometimes it can be a bit annoying when you start programming because the errors will pop up immediately when you type anything. Although in the end the error warnings are vital for correctly finishing your code and verifying that it works. Instead of compiling and running it right away and looking through the console for the error and where it is located, ESLint lets you know the issue real-time. Especially in WODs where you have to solve a problem in a given time, coding standards and ESLint warnings are crucial to successfully completing the WOD. That said, having coding standards and doing the little things like a curly brace on its own line will always be worth the trouble.</p>
