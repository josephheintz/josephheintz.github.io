## Reflect on Software Engineering

For me personally I lacked a practical background in the software engineering field prior to this class. Thus, this class was both a challenge and fun learning experience which was above all extremely helpful with building my career in software development. I was able to obtain a better understanding of how web applications are developed by a team by a certain deadline. Compared to ICS 211 where there were more puzzle-solving skills, ICS 314 was more fast-paced and structured differently. A bit of a stress factor was added to our learning environment and practical uses for coding were demonstrated. Some new languages and frameworks were introduced to me like JavaScript, HTML, React, Meteor, etc. Using several of these different tools helped me develop better pattern recognition. Over time my ability to efficiently use or learn these software engineering utilities increased. This class is required for my degree, but I thoroughly enjoyed taking it and developing new skills.
